  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small" id="p" > We are a start-up in 2021 . This thought came in mind when were studing and i did't had enough material to study. I was looking for the book but shops were closed due to pendmic and did't able to find that book online. So, we thought we should start a platform where anyone can come and look for the books that they want. If the book is not there in the EduLab Liabary then he or she can put the request for the book and we will arrange the book for the person. Not only the acedemics we also have diffrent kind of novals like drama , comic books etc. You will get solution of every problem here.

 <p class="sectionTag text-big">Don't Struggle to find Books...</p>
 <p class="sectionSubTag text-small" id="p" >An electronic book, also known as an e-book or eBook, is a book publication made available in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of computers or other electronic devices.[1] Although sometimes defined as "an electronic version of a printed book", some e-books exist without a printed equivalent. E-books can be read on dedicated e-reader devices, but also on any computer device that features a controllable viewing screen, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.Some trace the concept of an e-reader, a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen, to a 1930 manifesto by Bob Brown, written after watching his first "talkie" (movie with sound). He titled it The Readies, playing off the idea of the "talkie".In his book, Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the "talkies" and, as a result, reading should find a new medium.
